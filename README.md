## 1. What is a JWT?
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

## Use Cases
**Authentication**

JWTs are widely used for authentication. When the user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client. The client then sends the JWT with each subsequent request. The server can verify the JWT to check the user's authentication status.

**Information Exchange**

JWTs can be used to securely transmit information between parties. Because they can be signed, you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

**API Authorization**

JWTs are used to secure APIs. Each request to a protected endpoint carries a JWT, which the server can validate before allowing access to the resource.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**

1) Stateless Authentication: JWTs are self-contained tokens that carry all the required information, eliminating the need to store session information on the server.
2) Compact and URL-safe: JWTs are compact in size and can be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
3) Security: JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair (using RSA or ECDSA).
4) Interoperability: JWTs are widely used and supported across different platforms and languages, facilitating interoperability.

**Cons**

1) Size: JWTs can become large if they contain too many claims, leading to increased bandwidth usage.
2) Complexity: Implementing JWT correctly requires a good understanding of security practices to avoid vulnerabilities.
3) Token Revocation: Revoking a JWT can be challenging since they are stateless. Typically, you cannot easily revoke a token unless you maintain a blacklist or use short-lived tokens.
4) Exposure Risk: If the token is not properly secured, it can be stolen and used by malicious parties.
